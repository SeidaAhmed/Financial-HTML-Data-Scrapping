# Financial-HTML-Data-Scrapping

## Introduction

For this project, I was given the task of converting financial data (HTML format) from several websites into machine-readable format. My major goal was to capture and clean financial outlook HTML formatted tabular data so that it could be analyzed further. Implementing several web scraping methods and tools, some of which were unfamiliar to me, is part of the process. It took me 20 hours to learn the new tools from various online resources as well as from the training I got from the company. Then, applying the skill I acquired I managed to successfully capture the required information, which took me around 30-40 hours. Finally, the data cleaning part which includes removing duplicate values, null values etc. which required around 15-20 hours. The final submission of my code is in the shared drive in google colab which is provided by the company.


## Web scrapping
This section necessitated gathering tabular information from multiple websites and ensuring that the information was accurate. I needed to be able to collect the data from the given websites into python data frame before it could be processed. The majority of my time was spent viewing videos on how to use the bs4(beautiful soup) library in Python. Finally, with the company's help, I was able to effectively gather the required data.

## Data frame cleaning
After I manage to capture the data in python data frame format the next step was to clean the data. Which includes, removing duplicate values and null values. And making sure that my solution is general so that it can be applied across companies.
Converting data frame to dictionary
As per the requirement of the company the last step in this project was to convert the cleaned data frame into python dictionary. I got all the formatting from the company and based on that I manage to convert the data frame into dictionary.
Overall, the project was completed on time, and the required number of hours were met by learning new technologies and coding. The below screen shots show some of my work in this project:
